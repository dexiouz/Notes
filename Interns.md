Barnabas

The admin of the class. Barnabas is someone to be described as administrative. Very principled and not short of humility. What will draw you close to him is his unwavering desire to know, to teach others and to put the class in order. He is the defacto person to be likened as the prefect of the cohort.

When the journey gets tough, he admits of the boisterous wind but he will not give up. Here and there you will see him confiding in his fellow interns to understand the concept which seemed like a challenge to him. It will not be long to see him beaming with smiles of success, having trashed the bug. A true leader indeed, he took his team to build awesome things in their just concluded Jumia clone project.

Dennis
On first encounter with Dennis, you will notice his zeal and passion for tech. Having not come from a tech background, his dispositions both in words and the zealous manner in which he carries on his everyday task points to one thing; Dennis wants to make an impact impact in an un-tech area using technology.

His love for accepting new challenges and running with the intent of solving them is somethiing I have personally come to love about him. His huge figure is also something he has taken advantage of as he is willing to volunteer to do some of the more physically-exhaustive works. His team play and collaborative spirit is par excellence as you can see him flowing freely with everybody.

Blessed

When you meet Blessed the second time, he has not come to share greetings but to seek clarifications on what he is currently working on. Blessed is very voracious with obtaining the available knowledge. He asks too many questions and will not stop until he is clarified. That's a thumbs up for a developer like him. The first time you meet him, he will always wear a face cap.

A great teacher too, once in a while you see him on the board taking the pleasure of explaining difficult concepts to his mates just so they can be upto par with the status of the lecture. Obviously, when it comes to team play he is willing to put in his best and ensure the success of the task at hand.

Blossom

Blossom is the brother to Blessed. You will know, not because I've told you but because of the resemblance. The very last to join the cohort yet not deterred to ensure that he grabs something tangible. His hardwork is better appreciate(d) if you consider that he joined when the cohort was already on reactjs. And under the extra tutelage of his brother, he is mastering html, css, and javascript.

To show his level of commitment, as at the time of this writing. he is already having a good time learning and building mobile Apps with react native. The future is bright for such unrelenting person and its obvious that Blossom is that person.
