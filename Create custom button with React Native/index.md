It is quite exceptional I must say, to come across someone like Jude. I was fortunate to have known him in 2019 when he came as a complete newbie and joined the Learnfactory Nigeria's rigorous six months software development bootcamp.
 For someone who was completely new to programmming, he didn't get discouraged but went ahead to beat all expectations. 
 A Very proactive and hardworking individual; a team player and an intelligent leader. 
 If you are looking for a very talented developer to take your products or teams to the next level, then Jude is your best bet.
